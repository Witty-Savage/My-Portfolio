      My name is Nafisa Mohammed, and I am originally from Ghana. I am currently in my second year of the Ph.D. program in Rhetoric and Professional Communication in the English Department. Alongside my studies, I work part-time as a Graduate Assistant Instructor, where I teach first-year composition courses as well as classes in Technical and Professional Communication (TPC).

Teaching has become one of the most rewarding parts of my graduate journey. I enjoy creating supportive learning spaces, guiding students through their writing challenges, and discovering new ideas through our classroom conversations. Each semester, my students teach me just as much as I teach them about language, culture, creativity, and the many ways people make meaning in the world.

Beyond teaching and coursework, I am passionate about professional communication, accessibility in writing, multilingual literacies, and the experiences of international students navigating academic spaces. These interests continue to shape my research, the projects I pursue, and the ways I show up in the classroom..

<h2>Fictional Business Website Project</h2>
<div class="project-description">
<p>
This is a collaborative project from my Web Developmemnt class. We created a fully functional fictional business website for Moe's Tavern from the Simpson's show.
We focused on building a cohesive brand identity, applying consistent design principles, and developing
clear documentation to guide potential collaborators.
</p>
<p>
<strong>My Role:</strong> I served as the content writer for all the pages. I was responsible for documenting some markdown files and my work was focused on creativity, making the language accessible, professional, and aligned with our
business website branding identity.
