  <p> My name is Nafisa Mohammed. I am originally from Ghana. I am currently in my second year in the Ph.D. Rhetoric & Professional program at the English department. I am also employed part-time as a graduate assistant instructor at the department where I teach first-year college composition classed and courses in Technical Professional Communication (TPC). The best part about my teaching job is interacting with my students and learning new stuff from them
