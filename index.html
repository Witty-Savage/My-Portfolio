      My name is Nafisa Mohammed. I am originally from Ghana and currently
      in my second year in the Ph.D. Rhetoric & Professional program at the
      English department. I am also employed part-time as a graduate
      assistant instructor at the department where I teach first-year college
      composition classes and courses in Technical Professional Communication
      (TPC). The best part about my teaching job is interacting with my
      students and learning new stuff from them.

<h2>Fictional Business Website Project</h2>
<div class="project-description">
<p>
This is a collaborative project from my Web Developmemnt class. We created a fully functional fictional business website for Moe's Tavern from the Simpson's show.
We focused on building a cohesive brand identity, applying consistent design principles, and developing
clear documentation to guide potential collaborators.
</p>
<p>
<strong>My Role:</strong> I served as the content writer for all the pages. I was responsible for documenting some markdown files and my work was focused on creativity, making the language accessible, professional, and aligned with our
business website branding identity.
